                    <div id="one" class="collapse">
                    <p>Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others. The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour. The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average. The steps in the process are:
                        <br><p>Registration</p>
                       <div> <ol><li>You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).
                               </li><li>You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.</li></ol></div>
                    <p>Health History and Mini Physical</p>
                        <div><ol><li>You will answer some questions during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.
                                </li><li>You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.</li></ol></div>
                    <p>Donation</p>
                        <div><ol><li>We will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.
                                </li><li>You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)
                                </li><li>When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.
                                </li></ol></div>
                    <p> Refreshments</p>
                        <div> <ol><li>You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume.
                                </li><li>After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities.
                                </li><li>Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.
                                </li></ol></div>Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.

                    <div id="two" class="collapse">
                    <p>Take the following precautions:<br>
                        <div  >
                        <ul><li>Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.</li>
                            <li> Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.</li>
                            <li> If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.</li>
                            <li> Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.</li>
                            <li> Eat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.</li></ul>
                    </div><div>If you get a bruise:</div> <div class="padder">Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.
                    </div><br><div>If you get dizzy or lightheaded :</div>
                        <div class="padder">Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.
                        </div><br>And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!
                        Schedule your next appointment .
                        If this is your first donation, expect your Donor Card in the mail within 6-8 weeks.

HIV antibodies may take a few weeks to develop after infection with the virus. If you were recently infected, you might have a negative test result, yet be able to infect the recipient of your donation. That is why you must not give blood if you are at risk of getting AIDS or other infectious diseases. Individuals at risk for contracting HIV should contact their local health department for AIDS testing.</p>

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>Blood is universally recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions.
                        The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. More than 29 million units of blood components
                        are transfused every year. Donate Blood Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly
                        attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by effectively
                        connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.</p>
